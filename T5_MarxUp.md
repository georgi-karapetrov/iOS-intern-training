# Introduction
[_A spectre is haunting Europe — the spectre of communism._](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm)

The year's 2018. Present day, but different times. The Soviet Union has never fallen. In fact, it's world power numer one, tailed by the United States of America. The Iron curtain has been lifted. The market, although not free, offers quite the range of Western commodities. Welcome to an altered future. Coca-Cola costs 35 Roubles in every country in Europe. No Big Mac-s, though.

# The task at hand

«Receiving incoming transmission»
Дорогой/-ая товарищ/-арка, the Central Committee has a special assignment for you. A recent study by the Comintern has discovered that the Proletarian youth, as it is in its current state, has strode so far away from the values of the respectable contemporary communist, that the Committee has started to doubt the previously passed vote for lifting the Iron curtain to the 'commodities of the West', proposed by «certain» members of the Comintern. We need to find a way reach out to the «nadsat-vozrostnyh» (oh how I hate this newly-coined term, they call it «teenagers» in the West). Fear not, however, as we stand here with a solution: a corageous proposition by some of the few molodezhy, not fallen victims of the corrupted western influence.

# The Communist Scrapbook

## The Holy Scripts

Although critical and requiring urgent measures, the task is far from unachievable for a young and passionate lad like yourself. Create a mobile application for one of those western spy gadgets they call iPhone (or, as a matter of fact, the bigger one called iPad). The app should be handy and modern way of preaching our philosophy and political views. This will be achieved by distributing a free (we are no [capitalist pigs](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/023/177/Screen_Shot_2017-06-09_at_4.34.34_PM.jpg) after all) [copy of the sacred texts of The Manifesto](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Manifesto.pdf). However, the users should be able to take their own notes and write their interpretation directly on the pages of the book, for future re-readings. Circles, rounded and regular rectangles, arrows and even handwriting, is what is to be in the toolbox of the application. While on the matter, make it so that they can do those things to any book they have on their device. Here I found some information which might prove to be of use: [PDFKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pdfkit?language=objc), [PDFAnnotation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pdfkit/pdfannotation?language=objc).

## The Shattered Memories

The second part of our glorious and contemporary application is targeted against Western media and negative influence on the minds of the adolescent. Infiltrate the infrastructure of [this](https://imgur.com/) evil capitalist website and make it so that any user can preview its photo content and scratch up with profanity any capitalist propaganda poster they stumble upon. This is done in a manner, similar to the one in the "Holy Scripts" section. A breach into the enemy website has been discovered [here](https://apidocs.imgur.com). If you ever feel unconvinced in your own capabilities, seek help [here](https://www.raywenderlich.com/2862-how-to-make-a-simple-drawing-app-with-uikit). Scribblers unite!

## The Cult of Personality

What a better way to develop love for oneself but through the ability to capture one's supple frame and enhance it through the means of technology? It is our duty, tovarisch/tovarka, to cater to these needs of the adolescent. And our application will do it. Let them take pictures (of themselves and others) and allow them to beautify them through filters and drawing. What a glorious day to be alive!

## Кот
Comrade, if you deem this possible, please add a feature to the application where the random stream of capitalist propaganda is cathegorized, so that to make it easier for our counterintelligence to analyze it. Our Western comrades have created a useful tool for tedious tasks like these. It is located [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

Make haste, comrade.
